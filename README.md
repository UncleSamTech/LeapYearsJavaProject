# LeapYearsJavaProject
This project allows users to enter integer numbers that have a length limit of 4 and validates it to check whether it falls into a leap year

This project is created by Samuel Iwuchukwu
The project was written in java
This project is meant to help java programmers easily iterate through years and get leap years out of it
Note that only valid integers that have a length of four are allowed  
The project is open for collaboration and input from other programmers
